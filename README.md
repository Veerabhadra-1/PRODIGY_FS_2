# Employee Management System 
🚀 Excited to share my Task-02 from my internship at Prodigy InfoTech
 – Employee Management System 👨‍💼✨
In this task, I developed a web application that allows administrators to perform full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on employee records. 🔧
🔐 To ensure data security, I implemented:
 ✅ Authentication & Authorization using JWT
 ✅ Password Hashing with bcrypt
 ✅ Validation using express-validator
 ✅ Protected sensitive employee data with secure backend APIs
🔧 Tech Stack Used:
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB 🍃
Frontend: React ⚛️, Material UI 🎨, Axios for API integration
Other Tools: JWT, bcrypt, express-validator
This project helped me gain practical experience in building secure, full-stack applications with proper validation, authentication, and user role management. 💻🔒
